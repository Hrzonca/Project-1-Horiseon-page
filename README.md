Title 
Setting Yourself Up for Success by Horiseon 

Description 

The motivations of this project is to increase the accessibility of the horiseon site for more users. We were given a functional site that had some linking issues as well as unnessasry code. Our goal for the front face was to fix issues such as page jumping when the link is clicked as well as adding descriptions to all the images for people with disabilities to be read aloud. 

On the coding side:
The HTML recived a title. As well as semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, section, aside and footer elements instead of sections that says div. Each image recieved an alt tag with a description of the image for assceibilty. Added an ID to the search engine optimization section to allow the jump to the section on the live page. While also giving the hero section its own section without being in the search engine optimization section.     

the CSS was condensed to make the sections easier to read. Any sematic HTML elements that were changed were translated into the CSS for proper function. A global change in font family was placed in the body section while the header and footer recieved a different font family based on the original code. The repeat in code for each section was condensed by placing multiple headers in the same line seperated by commas to have the same effect. The CSS was placed in a logical order where the "benefit" section which is part of the side bar is below the left side content. 

While doing this project we learned how to increase asscessibilty for everyone. As well as being able to recongize the changes that you made to one needs to be translated to the other in order for the site to function properly. We were able to clean up the code by condensing and putting the sections in a logical order.
